WHY JAVA KNOWN TO BE A PLATFORM INDEPENDENT LANGUAGE?

*Java is an object oriented programming language  developed by james gosling and owned by sun microsystems,presently owned by oracle.
*Java known to be platform independent languague because it is guaranteed to be write once and run anywhere(WORA)that means java code that runs on one system or platform doesnot  need to be recompiled to run on another platform.
*Java programs are platform independent which means they can run on any operating system example:Windows,Liux.
*On compilation java program is compiled into bytecode,this bytecode is paltform independent and can be run on any machine
*Byte code format also provide security,this is one of the feature of java.
*Byte code:Bytecode is computer object code that is processed by a program,usually referred to as a virtual machine.In other words bytecode is compiled format for java programs.
*The source code that is program written in java is saved as a file with .java extenstion eg:MyWorld.java.The java compiler "javac" compiles the source code and produces the code called byte code.The byte code generated by the compiler is saved as a file with .class extenstion eg:MyWorld.class
*Uses of java:Java is also used as the programming languague for many different software programs,games
*Eg:Android apps,Adobe,Eclipse etc.
*Above all makes java a platform independent language and widely used top most popular programming langauage.
